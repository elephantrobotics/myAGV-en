### 4 Functional features
* 1.Omnidirectional wheel trolley: four McNally wheels, full package design;

* 2.Slam lidar navigation and mapping: real time movement and drawing construction; Autonomous navigation;

* 3.Built in camera: it can identify and accurately locate objects;

* 4.Minimum composite robot: up to 2 mycobot robots can be carried and peripheral actuators can be equipped;

* 5.hand eye calibration: mycobot can accurately locate and calibrate the camera and grab it in a large range;

* 6.Rich teaching system: support ROS simulation and moveit all open source; Meanwhile, the interface is rich: Raspberry pie, Arduino, python, c++;

* 7.Multiple ways of play: it can be coordinated by multiple machines, controlled in multiple ways, and multiple robots can move in real time.

### 5 Application

* Laser radar and slam navigation diagram.

* eye-in-hand identification and grab, using different end effector.

* Automatic driving
